 * Practice Using an Iterator
 * Write a program to create a collection of Integer values. Randomly generate 20 numbers between 1 and 100.
 * Add these numbers to the collection. Use an iterator to step through the collection and remove all elements
 * that are evenly divisible by 3. Afterwards display the size of the collection and the number of removed elements.
 * (Which should add up to 20 )
